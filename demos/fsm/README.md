# FSM demo — "ServiceCo"

The first demo vertical: a small Swedish service/installation firm built on the
Substrat kernel and the work-order + invoicing engines. **Runs end-to-end**: React UI →
Hono API → kernel operations → per-scope SQLite, with the tuple permission engine
enforcing every call.

## Run it

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm fsm-demo dev   # from anywhere in the repo — starts API (:8787) + web app (:5173)
```

(`pnpm fsm-demo <script>` is a root-level pass-through to this package: `dev`,
`server`, `test`, `typecheck` all work.)

Open http://localhost:5173 and **sign in** as any persona (auth is Better Auth on
both the node server and the Worker — see below; password is `demo1234` for all):

| Sign in as | Role | What to try |
|---|---|---|
| `anna@elmontage.se` (kontor) | office-admin | Create a work order, assign Harald, complete it — the priced review sheet shows min-qty and dropped internal articles; then export the fakturaunderlag |
| `harald@elmontage.se` (tekniker) | technician | Start the job, report time and material; try assigning — denied |
| `berit@brfgrunden.se` (portal) | BRF Grunden customer | Sees exactly her organization's orders — via a tuple proof walk, not UI filtering |
| `styrbjorn@kontorshotellet.se` (portal) | Kontorshotellet customer | Sees nothing of Berit's orders |
| `mallory@rorservice.se` | office-admin of *another firm* | Logs into her **own** tenant — sees none of ElMontage's data (empty lists), because she resolves to a different tenant/scope entirely |

Data lives in `demos/fsm/.data/*.sqlite` — open any scope file in a SQLite browser;
that's the escrow story, live. Delete `.data/` to reseed.

## On Cloudflare

The exact same vertical runs unchanged on the real Cloudflare runtime — the node
dev server ([src/server.ts](src/server.ts)) and the Worker ([src/worker.ts](src/worker.ts))
mount **one shared route table** ([src/routes.ts](src/routes.ts)) and the same Better
Auth seam ([src/auth-adapters.ts](src/auth-adapters.ts)); only the *adapter* underneath
differs. On the node server the pure-SQLite host backs the scopes and Better Auth's own
store; on Cloudflare those become Durable Objects and a D1 database respectively.

```bash
pnpm --dir demos/fsm cf:dev      # build the SPA + run the Worker on real workerd (local DOs, no account)
pnpm --dir demos/fsm cf:deploy   # ship it (needs a Workers Paid plan — DO SQLite)
```

### How the pieces connect

Everything lives behind **one origin**: the Worker owns `/api/*`, and the same-origin
`ASSETS` binding serves the built React SPA (so Better Auth's session cookie is
same-origin — no CORS). The Worker isolate itself is **stateless**: the Better Auth
instance and the `CloudflareScopeHost` coordinator are rebuilt per request. All durable
state lives below it — in D1 and the Durable Objects.

```mermaid
graph TB
  subgraph browser["🌐 Browser (one origin)"]
    SPA["React SPA<br/><i>app/dist</i>"]
  end

  subgraph edge["☁️ Cloudflare Worker — <i>src/worker.ts</i> (stateless, per-request)"]
    HONO["Hono app<br/>routes.ts (shared table)"]
    BA["Better Auth instance<br/><i>auth.ts</i> — identity/credentials/sessions"]
    HOST["CloudflareScopeHost<br/>coordinator — <i>adapter-cloudflare</i>"]
    SEAM["auth adapters (identity seam)<br/><i>auth-adapters.ts</i>"]
    HONO --> SEAM
    SEAM --> BA
    SEAM --> HOST
    HONO --> HOST
  end

  subgraph state["💾 Durable state (below the isolate)"]
    D1[("D1 — AUTH_DB<br/>user · session · account<br/><i>Better Auth's own store</i>")]
    CP["ControlPlaneDO (singleton)<br/>tenants · scope lifecycle · roles<br/>tenant tuples · entitlements<br/><b>identity links</b> · audit log"]
    SD1["ScopeDO — scope 01JZ…02<br/><i>own SQLite: tuples · outbox · module tables</i>"]
    ASSETS["ASSETS binding<br/>static SPA"]
  end

  SPA -->|"GET /  ·  static"| ASSETS
  SPA -->|"/api/auth/* (login)"| BA
  SPA -->|"/api/* (data)"| HONO
  BA <-->|Drizzle d1| D1
  HOST -->|"directory RPC"| CP
  HOST -->|"getScope · invoke"| SD1
  SD1 -.->|"tenant tuples · roles<br/>(permission eval)"| CP
```

**Authentication vs. authorization stay split.** Better Auth owns *authentication*
only (who you are) in its own D1 database; the kernel keeps *authorization*
(roles/grants/tenancy) in the Durable Objects. The bridge between them is the
**identity seam**: a Better-Auth `userId` is mapped to a kernel `PrincipalId` through
`resolveIdentity` in the ControlPlaneDO. That's why Better Auth's org/RBAC plugins stay
off — and why an OIDC/SSO adapter later is pure config on the same seam, no kernel change.

### One authenticated request, end to end

An authenticated data call (say `GET /api/workorders`, session cookie attached) crosses
each boundary exactly once — auth seam → coordinator → the scope's own Durable Object,
where the operation runs inside a single SQLite transaction with the tuple checker
enforcing the permission:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant B as Browser (SPA)
  participant W as Worker / Hono<br/>(routes.ts)
  participant BA as Better Auth
  participant CP as ControlPlaneDO
  participant SD as ScopeDO (this scope)

  B->>W: GET /api/workorders (cookie)
  W->>BA: getSession(headers)
  BA->>BA: read session from D1
  BA-->>W: { user.id }
  W->>CP: resolveIdentity('better-auth', user.id)
  CP-->>W: PrincipalId + tenant/scope
  W->>CP: getScope → validateScopeAccess (lifecycle gate)
  CP-->>W: ok
  W->>SD: invoke('workorder/list', …, principal)
  Note over SD: ctx.storage.transaction:<br/>① check permission (scope tuples local,<br/>tenant tuples via CP) ② run handler<br/>③ emit events → outbox
  SD->>CP: tenant tuples + role (for the check)
  CP-->>SD: rows
  SD-->>W: result (or PermissionDenied → 403)
  W-->>B: JSON
```

### What's inside a ScopeDO

A ScopeDO **is the app binary**: `defineScopeDO([...MODULES])` bundles the kernel spine,
the three engines, and the ServiceCo vertical module into one code-time set (a DO can't
receive handler closures over RPC), each with its own SQLite. One DO instance per scope,
addressed by `scopeId`; the coordinator just routes to it. This is the direct CF analogue
of a single `SqliteScopeHost` scope in the node run — same engines, same invariants, same
migrations, same tuple checker.

```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph do["ScopeDO — one per scope, own SQLite"]
    direction TB
    K["kernel spine<br/>ctx.sql · emit · check · link · migrations"]
    subgraph eng["engines (star topology, never import each other)"]
      WO["workorder"]
      INV["invoicing"]
      PROTO["protocol"]
    end
    V["ServiceCo module<br/><i>vertical — composes the engines</i>"]
    V --> WO & INV & PROTO
    WO & INV & PROTO --> K
    V --> K
  end
```

## Specs

- **Concept:** [spec/concept.md](spec/concept.md)
- **Implementation spec** (schemas, operations, events, permissions, scenario):
  [spec/testrun.md](spec/testrun.md)
- **View specifications:** [spec/views.md](spec/views.md)

`pnpm --filter @substrat-run/demo-fsm test` runs the headless nine-step scenario from
spec/testrun.md §8.

Demo verticals under `demos/` are private and never published. The engines they consume
live in `engines/` — product seeds shared across demos, not demo material.
