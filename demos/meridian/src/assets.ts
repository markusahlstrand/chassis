 * Serve the SPA from the worker itself (scope-local-permissions.md Phase 3).
 *
 * A pushed, sandbox-clean vertical has no `ASSETS` binding — WfP static assets are a
 * separate upload path, so the built SPA is inlined into `assets.generated.ts` (by
 * scripts/gen-assets.mjs) and served straight from the worker. This is the catch-all
 * behind the /api/* routes: an exact file hit is served; any other path (a client
 * route like /apps/123) falls back to index.html so deep links resolve. A missing
 * file *with* an extension is a real 404, not an SPA fallback.
