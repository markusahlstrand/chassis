# @substrat-run/engine-invoicing

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 604883b: Manifest-declared operation guards and operation withdrawal — compliance gates a reviewer can enumerate.

  A vertical declares an unconditional gate in its manifest (`guards: [{ before, predicate, config }]`); a module contributes the named predicate (`predicates` on `ModuleRegistration`, typed `GuardPredicate`); the kernel evaluates it inside the guarded operation's own transaction, before the handler, failing closed. `withdraws` lets a vertical suppress an engine's default operation binding so the guarded wrapper is the only door — without it a gate is reviewable but bypassable. Both are optional and additive: existing manifests parse and behave unchanged.

  The protocol engine gains a `protocol/all-signed` predicate and the `requireCountersigned` in-scope function; the work-order engine exports `closeWorkOrder` as an in-scope function (its `workorder/close` operation is now the thin binding). The scope-host contract suite covers guards and withdrawal, so every adapter must implement both.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7583dab: First end-to-end feature set: the kernel deltas that carry a running vertical.

  - **Contracts**: relationship tuples with proof-path `Decision`s (an unexplained allow is
    unrepresentable), entity-narrowed capability grants, `entityRelations` and `ui`
    contributions on the module manifest, shared `money` schema with exact decimal
    arithmetic, attachment `visibility` classification.
  - **Kernel**: `registerModule` (manifest + migrations + operations + consumers),
    `OperationContext.link`, entity-aware `PermissionChecker`, `HostAdmin` surface for
    roles/assignments/grants/membership, `assertAllowed`/`PermissionDenied`.
  - **adapter-sqlite**: built-in constrained tuple permission engine (fixed four-rule
    algebra, proof paths, grant expiry, org membership), per-scope migration journal
    (lazy on wake, crash-safe), per-operation transactions (writes and emitted events
    commit or roll back together), local at-least-once event dispatch with a kernel
    delivery journal and system-actor consumer contexts.
  - **contract-tests**: atomicity, migration-journal, dispatch exactly-once, and tuple
    permission suites — every adapter must pass all of them unchanged.
  - **Engines**: first releases of `@substrat-run/engine-workorder` (state machine, append-only
    time/material, fat completion events) and `@substrat-run/engine-invoicing` (event-consuming
    snapshot fakturaunderlag with provenance, immutable once exported).
