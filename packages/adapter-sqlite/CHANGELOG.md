### Patch Changes

- db77d8c: `HostAdmin` is now asynchronous

  Every `HostAdmin` method returns a `Promise` — writes (`createTenant`,
  `setTenantStatus`, the scope-lifecycle transitions, `defineRole`/`assignRole`/
  `grant`/`grantToOrg`/`addMember`, `grantEntitlement`/`revokeEntitlement`,
  `linkIdentity`) and reads (`getTenant`, `listTenants`, `listEntitlements`,
  `auditLog`, `resolveIdentity`) alike. `registerModule`/`defineOperation` stay
  synchronous (code-time bookkeeping); `getScope`/`provisionScope` were already async.

  Why: the pure adapter's synchronous admin worked only because it is in-process.
  The Cloudflare adapter (D-14) proved a durable/remote control plane — a Durable
  Object — cannot be synchronous, so the second adapter forced the interface to
  evolve. This is the two-adapter discipline doing its job. Callers now `await`
  admin calls; adapter-sqlite's methods present their synchronous SQLite work as
  Promises. Behavior, error messages, and every contract assertion are unchanged.

- d929987: Control plane §4.3: entitlement store — `manifest.entitlementKey` finally gates loading

  `manifest.entitlementKey` was declared on every module and read by nothing (D-20
  was a promise with no mechanism). Now a per-tenant `_substrat_entitlements` set
  gates module loading, default-deny: an operation whose owning module's SKU flag
  the tenant does not hold does not resolve — the same fail-closed shape as manifest
  `withdraws`. New `HostAdmin.grantEntitlement`/`revokeEntitlement` (idempotent,
  audited) and `listEntitlements`. The check runs per invoke (the simple, uncached
  path — a DO-cached variant is kernel-design open question 5). Entitlement flags
  are the SKUs meter 2 (§5) counts. Demo seeds grant the flags for the modules each
  vertical runs — the SKU model in use.

- f717014: Control plane §4.4: `PlatformActor` seam + append-only admin audit log (D-30, K-20)

  Every `HostAdmin` mutation (defineRole / assignRole / grant / grantToOrg / addMember)
  now takes a `PlatformActorId` — a staff subject branded distinctly from a tenant
  `PrincipalId` — and writes an append-only row to a new `_substrat_admin_log` in the
  directory, stamped host-side (actor, action, target, before/after, timestamp). A new
  `HostAdmin.auditLog(filter?)` reads it back — the read path for the console history and
  the permission-diff human checkpoint. `defineRole` captures the prior role in `before`.

  Pre-release breaking surface change kept at patch: `HostAdmin` method signatures gained
  a leading `actor` argument. Locally the actor is a dev stub; real staff auth gates
  exposing the surface, not building it.

- 6393a8e: Control plane §4.2: scope lifecycle + structural audit + mandatory tenant

  `provisionScope` becomes the first audited scope-lifecycle transition — it now
  takes a `PlatformActor`, requires an existing active tenant (a scope with no
  tenant record fails closed), and audits. New `HostAdmin.suspendScope`,
  `unsuspendScope`, `archiveScope`, and `unarchiveScope` implement the §3.3
  transitions, validate the legal transition graph (fail closed on an illegal
  one), and audit before/after; un-archive is an explicit restore, never a silent
  flag flip. `getScope` now gates on both tenant-active AND scope-active, so
  suspend/archive actually contain.

  Audit is now a single `recordAdmin` choke point every mutation routes through —
  "no mutation without a durable record" holds by construction, not per-method
  discipline. The step-2 "legacy scopes without a tenant" passthrough is removed:
  every scope has a tenant with a status.

- 2dd4175: Control plane §4.1: tenant registry + lifecycle status

  A real `tenants` table in the directory replaces "a tenant is a ULID nobody used
  before". New `HostAdmin.createTenant` (idempotent, audited), `setTenantStatus`,
  `listTenants`, and `getTenant`. A tenant whose status is not `active` fails
  `getScope` closed for every scope under it — the K-3 fail-closed path, the
  containment lever for non-payment or an incident, reversible without deletion.
  Scopes provisioned without a tenant record (legacy path) are not gated, keeping
  the change backward-compatible.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 604883b: Manifest-declared operation guards and operation withdrawal — compliance gates a reviewer can enumerate.

  A vertical declares an unconditional gate in its manifest (`guards: [{ before, predicate, config }]`); a module contributes the named predicate (`predicates` on `ModuleRegistration`, typed `GuardPredicate`); the kernel evaluates it inside the guarded operation's own transaction, before the handler, failing closed. `withdraws` lets a vertical suppress an engine's default operation binding so the guarded wrapper is the only door — without it a gate is reviewable but bypassable. Both are optional and additive: existing manifests parse and behave unchanged.

  The protocol engine gains a `protocol/all-signed` predicate and the `requireCountersigned` in-scope function; the work-order engine exports `closeWorkOrder` as an in-scope function (its `workorder/close` operation is now the thin binding). The scope-host contract suite covers guards and withdrawal, so every adapter must implement both.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7583dab: First end-to-end feature set: the kernel deltas that carry a running vertical.

  - **Contracts**: relationship tuples with proof-path `Decision`s (an unexplained allow is
    unrepresentable), entity-narrowed capability grants, `entityRelations` and `ui`
    contributions on the module manifest, shared `money` schema with exact decimal
    arithmetic, attachment `visibility` classification.
  - **Kernel**: `registerModule` (manifest + migrations + operations + consumers),
    `OperationContext.link`, entity-aware `PermissionChecker`, `HostAdmin` surface for
    roles/assignments/grants/membership, `assertAllowed`/`PermissionDenied`.
  - **adapter-sqlite**: built-in constrained tuple permission engine (fixed four-rule
    algebra, proof paths, grant expiry, org membership), per-scope migration journal
    (lazy on wake, crash-safe), per-operation transactions (writes and emitted events
    commit or roll back together), local at-least-once event dispatch with a kernel
    delivery journal and system-actor consumer contexts.
  - **contract-tests**: atomicity, migration-journal, dispatch exactly-once, and tuple
    permission suites — every adapter must pass all of them unchanged.
  - **Engines**: first releases of `@substrat-run/engine-workorder` (state machine, append-only
    time/material, fat completion events) and `@substrat-run/engine-invoicing` (event-consuming
    snapshot fakturaunderlag with provenance, immutable once exported).
