## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 27872cc: Scopes are provisioned as `provisioning` and activated on confirmation (K-31).

  `provisionScope` wrote the directory row as `active`, so the row claimed a usable
  scope before anything had built one — and only the vertical can build one, because the
  DO class bundles the modules and lives in the vertical's deployment. The `provisioning`
  state existed in the enum for exactly this and was unused.

  `HostAdmin.activateScope` moves `provisioning → active`, through the same transition
  graph the other lifecycle moves use, so it is audited and cannot revive a suspended
  scope. `getScope` refuses anything not active, so an unconfirmed row is inert rather
  than misleading.

  `ControlPlaneClient.activateScope` is the push-mode equivalent, and the control-plane
  API gains `POST /tenants/:t/scopes/:s/activate`.

  Migrations are still attempted for a `provisioning` scope before it is refused, so the
  lazy retry and its attempt counter survive — they are the only self-healing there is
  until the reconciliation sweep exists. A scope held back by a failed migration now
  reports the migration error rather than a bare "not active".

### Minor Changes

- c54637b: The hostname map: `hostname → (tenant, scope, vertical, surface, region)`.

  A provisioned scope had no URL, so "validate it works in production" had nowhere to
  point. `contracts/routing.ts` adds `hostnameBinding` and `routeTarget`, and `HostAdmin`
  adds `bindHostname` / `setHostnameStatus` / `listHostnames` / `resolveHostname`.

  `surface` is the correction: one hostname per scope was already wrong, because a single
  scope fronts a storefront and a back office, or a player app and a manager console.

  `region` sits on the binding rather than in a router deployed per jurisdiction, because
  Cloudflare's Regional Services is configured per hostname — residency is one more
  column, not a second topology.

  Bindings have a lifecycle (`pending` → `verifying` → `active`, or `failed` with a note),
  since a custom domain is DNS validation and certificate issuance rather than a string
  somebody sets. Only `active` resolves. `resolveHostname` takes no actor and is not
  logged — the machine-path carve-out `resolveIdentity` already has — and does not
  re-check suspension, which `getScope` owns.

  Additive on every published surface: new schemas, new `HostAdmin` methods, new tables.
  Nothing existing changed shape.

- 33fb5dd: Verticals can serve more than one tenant: the router's side of K-26, plus K-27.

  `@substrat-run/kernel` exports **`readRoutedNode`**, which reads the `(tenant, scope,
surface)` a router asserted in `x-substrat-*` headers and decides whether to trust it.
  Three outcomes, kept distinct: `null` when no router fronted the request (a standalone
  deploy substitutes its own node), a throw when the assertion is present but unsigned,
  incomplete or malformed, and the node when it is good. Collapsing the middle case into
  `null` would let a forged assertion fall through to whatever the caller does for
  "unrouted".

  Trust comes from a shared secret, compared in constant time. K-26's real boundary is
  that vertical workers have no public route — but that is a deployment fact and
  `workers.dev` is on by default, so the secret is what makes the boundary hold in code
  when the configuration slips.

  `@substrat-run/adapter-cloudflare` adds a **`/routing` subpath export** with
  `createRouteResolver`: hostname → route target over the control-plane DO, and nothing
  else. The package root re-exports the scope-DO class, which a router must not carry —
  it resolves a name and forwards, and should not be able to open a scope at all.

  `@substrat-run/contracts` now **normalizes hostnames to lower case** in the schema.
  DNS is case-insensitive, so storing `ACME.example.com` and `acme.example.com` as two
  rows would let two scopes each hold "the same" hostname and let a request resolve to
  whichever casing it arrived in.

  Additive: new exports and a new subpath. Nothing existing changed shape.

### Patch Changes

- ad89a9d: Fix: the router built one Durable Object stub and reused it across requests.

  A DO stub is an I/O object owned by the request that created it, so reusing one
  throws `Cannot perform I/O on behalf of a different request`. The first request after
  each cold start succeeded and every request after it returned 1101 — which is why
  nothing caught it before production: every test sent a single request.

  `createRouteResolver` now creates the stub inside the returned closure, per call, and
  the router no longer memoises the resolver. Only the namespace binding may be held
  across requests; nothing derived from one may be.

  `CloudflareScopeHost` has the same shape and is safe only because every worker
  rebuilds it per request. That requirement is now stated on the constructor.

### Minor Changes

- 6900431: The directory becomes readable, and gets an HTTP surface.

  **New package: `@substrat-run/control-plane-api`** (AGPL-3.0-only + commercial,
  like the kernel it sits on). One Hono router over `HostAdmin` — the audited
  control-plane transport. Web-standard only, so the same router mounts in a Worker
  holding the `controlPlane` binding or behind a Node server. It is not module code:
  it never receives a `ctx` and never runs in a scope's serialization domain.

  **`HostAdmin` gains a read side.** The write side was complete; nothing could
  enumerate what it had written.

  - `listScopes(filter?)` / `getScopeRecord(tenantId, scopeId)` — the scope
    inventory §3.2 always claimed the directory was. `getScopeRecord` cross-checks
    the pair and returns `undefined` for another tenant's scope, the same
    fail-closed rule `getScope` applies (K-3).
  - `listRoles(filter?)` — roles were writable and not enumerable since the
    permission model shipped. Returns `TenantRole` (a `RoleDefinition` plus its
    tenant).
  - `auditLog(filter?)` widens: filter by scope, actor, action or time; `limit`,
    `cursor` and `order`. The cursor is the entry's own ULID — order is
    chronological, so a page carries its own continuation. **The default order is
    unchanged** (oldest first), so existing callers do not shift.

  **The `scope` contract is now enforced rather than aspirational.** It described
  `slug`/`kind`/`name`/`parentScopeId` and was parsed by nothing while the table had
  none of those columns. Every read now parses through it, and `Scope` gains
  `vertical`.

  **`ProvisionScopeInput` extends additively** — `slug`, `kind`, `name`, `vertical`
  are optional with behaviour-preserving defaults, so existing callers are
  untouched. An unnamed scope's slug defaults to its lowercased id (a ULID
  lowercases into a valid slug, so it is valid and unique by construction).

  **`schemaVersion` and `vertical` stop being placeholders.** Both shipped as
  columns written by nothing — `schemaVersion` was always `'0'`, `vertical` always
  `null`. `schemaVersion` is now the applied-migration count; `vertical` is stamped
  onto audit targets for scope-lifecycle actions.

  **Directory schema change, applied in place by both adapters.** The `scopes` table
  gains `parent_scope_id`/`slug`/`kind`/`name`/`vertical`, plus a unique index on
  `(tenant_id, slug)` and one on `tenants(slug)`. The directory is not a module and
  has no `SqlMigration[]` journal, so each adapter upgrades on open: add the columns,
  backfill legacy rows to the same defaults `resolveScopeRecord` applies, then create
  the unique indexes **after** the backfill (a unique index over NULL slugs would
  permit the duplicates it exists to forbid). No action is required of callers; an
  existing directory opens and migrates itself.

  **Slug uniqueness is now enforced**, which it never was despite the contract saying
  "unique within tenant". `createTenant` and `provisionScope` fail closed on a
  collision rather than reporting a silent no-op — `INSERT OR IGNORE` would have
  swallowed a colliding-slug-different-id create and reported it as idempotent.

### Minor Changes

- 5dd4085: Zod 4, and `contracts` re-exports `z` — closing a live from-scratch trap

  **The trap.** The published packages depend on `zod ^3.25.0` while `pnpm add zod`
  — which getting-started told users to run — installs Zod 4. pnpm resolves both:
  Zod 3 nested for our packages, Zod 4 for the user. Two copies, both "correct".
  Zod schemas do not compose across majors, so the moment a user wrote the pattern
  CLAUDE.md mandates ("operation inputs go through Zod schemas at the boundary")
  composing a contracts schema into their own —

                  z.object({ facility: entityRef, unitPrice: money })

  — it failed at RUNTIME with `Invalid element at key "facility": expected a Zod
schema`, an error pointing nowhere near the cause. Not an exotic pattern: it is
  what `engines/workorder` itself does (`unitPrice: money`, `facility: entityRef`),
  so anyone copying the reference hit it immediately. Found by building a vertical
  from scratch against the published packages — the flow the docs describe and
  nobody had walked.

  **Two fixes, because they solve different halves.**

  1. **Zod 4 everywhere.** Aligns with what the ecosystem installs by default, so a
     user who reaches for `zod` gets our major. No code changes were needed — the
     schema subset in use (`z.object`, `.regex`, `.brand`, `.min`, `.optional`,
     `z.infer`) is stable across the major, and the one `z.record` was already the
     2-arg form Zod 4 requires. Build, typecheck, and the full suite pass unchanged.
  2. **`contracts` re-exports `z`.** The durable half: importing `z` from
     `@substrat-run/contracts` means the consumer never installs zod at all, so the
     versions cannot diverge. Fix 1 makes the trap dormant; fix 2 keeps it dormant
     when Zod 5 ships.

  `zod` is dropped from the getting-started install line; docs and the `substrat`
  skill both import `z` from contracts.

  **Breaking for consumers on Zod 3** — deliberately taken now, while there are
  effectively none, rather than later when there are.

  **Still open:** making `zod` a `peerDependency`. Contracts' schemas are part of
  its public API — consumers are meant to compose them, so their copy must be ours
  — which is textbook peer. As a plain dependency it nests silently instead of
  failing at install. Left as a separate call.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- db77d8c: `HostAdmin` is now asynchronous

  Every `HostAdmin` method returns a `Promise` — writes (`createTenant`,
  `setTenantStatus`, the scope-lifecycle transitions, `defineRole`/`assignRole`/
  `grant`/`grantToOrg`/`addMember`, `grantEntitlement`/`revokeEntitlement`,
  `linkIdentity`) and reads (`getTenant`, `listTenants`, `listEntitlements`,
  `auditLog`, `resolveIdentity`) alike. `registerModule`/`defineOperation` stay
  synchronous (code-time bookkeeping); `getScope`/`provisionScope` were already async.

  Why: the pure adapter's synchronous admin worked only because it is in-process.
  The Cloudflare adapter (D-14) proved a durable/remote control plane — a Durable
  Object — cannot be synchronous, so the second adapter forced the interface to
  evolve. This is the two-adapter discipline doing its job. Callers now `await`
  admin calls; adapter-sqlite's methods present their synchronous SQLite work as
  Promises. Behavior, error messages, and every contract assertion are unchanged.

- ffe3be1: Cloudflare adapter: durable control plane

  The coordinator's directory is now durable. `ControlPlaneDO` grew from the two-table
  checker slice into the full directory — tenants, scopes, entitlements, the admin
  audit log, identities, roles, and tenant-level tuples all in its SQLite (DDL and
  error messages ported verbatim from the pure adapter). `CloudflareScopeHost` is now
  a thin async router: it dropped the six in-memory directory maps and the
  enqueue/drain machinery, and `await`s RPCs to the DO for every admin mutation,
  lifecycle check, and read. It keeps only code-time registration bookkeeping in
  memory and still routes scope-level tuples to the owning ScopeDO. The control plane
  now survives a coordinator restart — the prerequisite for a stateless production
  Worker. Both contract suites stay green (CF 43+1 skip, adapter-sqlite 50).

- 4ba235e: Cloudflare Durable-Object adapter — milestone 1: contract suites green in workerd

  The second adapter (D-14) now runs the **shared** contract suites against **real
  Durable Objects** in workerd. One scope = one SQLite-backed `ScopeDO`; operations
  run inside `ctx.storage.transaction(async …)` (the DO analogue of the pure
  adapter's `BEGIN IMMEDIATE … COMMIT/ROLLBACK`), with per-scope serialization,
  lazy migrations-on-wake, guards, entity links, and the outbox→consumer dispatch
  loop. `scopeHostContractSuite` + `permissionContractSuite` pass unchanged (43
  pass, 1 skip); the pure-SQLite adapter stays green.

  - **contract-tests**: handlers extracted into an importable `modules.ts` so a DO
    can bundle them (a DO cannot execute closures created in another isolate);
    assertions unchanged. New `supportsRuntimeRegistration` capability flag — the
    one dynamic-late-registration test is skipped on adapters whose module set is
    code-time (CF), since a deployed DO bundle cannot gain code at runtime.
  - **kernel**: `ulid()` is now **monotonic** within a process (ULID spec's
    monotonic factory) — two ids minted in the same millisecond sort in creation
    order, making the audit log's and outbox's "ULID order is chronological"
    invariant actually hold. Fixes a latent same-millisecond ordering flake.

  Milestone-1 limitation, deliberately scoped: `HostAdmin` is a **synchronous**
  interface, which cannot be backed by an async Durable Object — so the coordinator
  holds the directory (tenants/scopes/entitlements/audit/identities/roles) in
  memory and forwards only the cross-DO subset (roles + tenant tuples) to a
  `ControlPlaneDO`. Making the control plane durable needs an async admin surface —
  a contract evolution the second adapter surfaced (exactly what D-14 is for), and
  the next step before deploying a real vertical.
