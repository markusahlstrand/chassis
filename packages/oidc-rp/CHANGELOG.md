# @substrat-run/oidc-rp

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- cc5f2ca: **`substrat login` — a real browser login for the CLI (loopback OAuth, no AuthHero change).**

  `substrat login` now pops the browser and authenticates you as yourself — the `wrangler login` / `gh auth login` experience — instead of pasting a shared token. The CLI never touches AuthHero: it logs in **through the control plane**, which already brokers AuthHero for the console, and gets back the same signed session it issues to a browser.

  - **The flow (PKCE, CLI ↔ control plane):** the CLI starts a localhost server, opens `…/api/auth/cli?port&state&challenge`; the broker signs the user in (bouncing through the existing `/api/auth/login` if there's no session yet, via a new same-origin `returnTo`) and redirects to `127.0.0.1:PORT/callback?code`; the CLI exchanges `code + verifier` for the session token. The token never transits a URL — only the PKCE-bound `code` does — and the exchange fails without the matching verifier.
  - **`@substrat-run/oidc-rp`**: exports `mintSession` (refactored out of `completeLogin`), `signEphemeral`/`verifyEphemeral`, `pkceS256`, and `safePath`; `mountOidcRoutes` honours a validated same-origin `returnTo`.
  - **`apps/control-plane`**: `oidcStaffBearerReader` accepts the session as `Authorization: Bearer` (the same `verifySession`, the **same staff roster** gate as the cookie); `cli-auth.ts` mounts the broker routes. Pushes are attributed to the **human**, not a shared actor. **No AuthHero client or redirect URI is added** — AuthHero still only ever redirects to the console.
  - **`@substrat-run/cli`**: the loopback `login` flow (default); `login --token` / `SUBSTRAT_SERVICE_TOKEN` still stores a service credential for CI. `push` sends whichever the config resolves — a bearer session (per-human) or `x-service-token` (service actor).

  Verified: oidc-rp, control-plane, dashboard and cli typecheck; a new workerd test drives the whole broker end-to-end — the PKCE round-trip issues a bearer the deploy surface accepts, a wrong verifier is refused (400), and a valid session for a non-rostered user is refused (401, fail closed).
